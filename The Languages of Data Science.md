The Languages of Data Science. For anyone just getting started on their data science journey, the range of technical options can be overwhelming. There is a dizzying amount of choice when it comes to programming languages. Each has it's own strengths and weaknesses and there is no one right answer to the question of which one you should learn first. The answer to that question depends largely on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and who you are solving them for.
Python, R, and SQL are the languages that we recommend you consider first and foremost. But there are so many others that have their own strengths and features. Scala, Java, C++, and Julia are some of the most popular. Javascript, PHP, Go, Ruby, and Visual Basic all have their own unique use cases as well.
The language you choose to learn will depend on the things you need to accomplish and the problems you need to solve. It will also depend on what company you work for, what role you have, and the age of your existing application. We’ll explore the answers to this question as we dive into the popular languages in the data science industry.
There are many roles available for people who are interested in getting involved in data science.
